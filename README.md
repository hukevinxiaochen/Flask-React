# Dill Flask

An implementation of [dillinger.io](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger) using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

This uses *React* and more JavaScript packages so you should have `npm`, and then install `browserify` globally.

`npm install -g browserify`

And then to install local dependencies be sure to run

`npm install`

It will read the `package.json` supplied by this repo.
